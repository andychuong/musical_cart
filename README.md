# Push to Play
A shopping cart designed to play music when it is moving. This is to assist a student who is highly motivated by music. The core of this project involves using a triple axis accelerometer to detect the movement of a shopping cart. Once the cart is in motion, our MP3 shield attached to our Arduino (SparkFun RedBoard) will play audio. 

This project was done in collaboration with Fletcher Miller Middle School to encourage a specific student in physical activity.
